## **🔷 Project Highlights 🔷**

🔒 This project aims to develop an open-source **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution to collect, analyze, and correlate security event data from multiple sources.

🔒 The goal is to provide enhanced **threat detection**, **incident response**, and improve overall **security posture**.

🔒 You'll be using **Splunk Enterprise**, **Splunk Universal Forwarder**, **Nmap**, and **Docker** to implement a robust SIEM solution.

🔒 This project offers **flexible components**, **thorough documentation**, and user-friendly interfaces for both beginner and advanced security professionals.

## **🔧 Capabilities 🔧**

🔹 Collects and ingests log data from multiple sources (servers, network devices, applications) using **Splunk Universal Forwarder**.

🔹 Correlates security event data and identifies potential threats using **Splunk Enterprise**.

🔹 Implements real-time monitoring and alerting based on defined **SIEM rules**.

🔹 Designed for both **scalability** and **flexibility**, making it adaptable to various environments.

🔹 Includes the use of **Nmap** with **Docker** to perform credential scanning tests, simulating an attacker attempting to access sensitive data.

---

## **🚨 Technologies 🚨**

🔹 **Linux**

🔹 **Ubuntu** (for deploying SIEM systems)

🔹 **Splunk Enterprise** (for log ingestion, analysis, and correlation)

🔹 **Splunk Universal Forwarder** (for remote log forwarding)

🔹 **Programming Language**: Python

🔹 **Log Management Best Practices**: Effective log organization, filtering, and event correlation

🔹 **Security Best Practices**: SIEM configuration, alerting, and event correlation

🔹 **Nmap** with **Docker**: Used to test and simulate credential scans as part of the vulnerability assessment for the SIEM system.

## **👀 Instructions 👀**

**🔹 PREREQUISITES 🔹**

🔹 A working **Linux** or **Ubuntu** system.

🔹 **Splunk Enterprise** and **Splunk Universal Forwarder** installed.

🔹 Basic understanding of **network protocols** and **log management**.

🔹 **Nmap** and **Docker** installed for testing credential scan simulations.

### **Steps:** ➡️❗ [Click Here To View Detailed Visual Steps](https://github.com/MJaloui/Building-a-SIEM/blob/main/VisualStepsHere.md) ❗⬅️

1. Set up **Splunk Enterprise** on your central server.

2. Install **Splunk Universal Forwarder** on remote systems to send logs to your Splunk server.

3. Configure **data inputs** to collect logs from various sources (network devices, applications, servers).

4. Develop custom **event correlation rules** for identifying potential threats.

5. Implement **real-time alerting** to notify of suspicious activities or anomalies.

6. **Test your SIEM system** by simulating a credential scan using **Nmap** with **Docker**.

   - First, pull the **Nmap Docker image**:
     ```bash
     docker pull instrumentisto/nmap
     ```

   - Run a **SYN scan** to check for open ports and services, simulating a potential credential scan:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm --network host instrumentisto/nmap -sS <target_ip>
     ```

   - Collect logs generated during this test to see how the SIEM reacts and if alerts are triggered.

7. Continuously refine your **SIEM system** to improve threat detection and reduce false positives.

### **✔️ Keynotes ✔️**

🔹 Building a custom **SIEM solution** with **Splunk Enterprise**.

🔹 Effective use of **log data** and network analysis tools for threat detection.

🔹 Applying **SIEM best practices** for system security, alerting, and data correlation.

🔹 Using **Nmap with Docker** to simulate real-world attacks like credential scanning and analyzing the results in the SIEM system.

---

### **🌱 Opportunities for Growth 🌱**

🔹 Use a network anaylsis tool for further investigation.

🔹 Add support for additional data sources (e.g., cloud services, endpoints).

🔹 Implement **machine learning algorithms** to improve threat detection accuracy.

🔹 Expand the system to handle **large-scale enterprise environments**.

🔹 Integrate with **external security tools** for advanced monitoring and reporting.
